"we first show how to construct an o(n)-depth o(n)-size quantum circuit for.addition of two n-bit binary numbers with no ancillary qubits. the exact size.is 7n-6, which is smaller than that of any other quantum circuit ever.constructed for addition with no ancillary qubits. using the circuit, we then.propose a method for constructing an o(d(n))-depth o(n)-size quantum circuit.for addition with o(n/d(n)) ancillary qubits for any d(n)=\omega(log n). if we.are allowed to use unbounded fan-out gates with length o(n^c) for an arbitrary.small positive constant c, we can modify the method and construct an.o(e(n))-depth o(n)-size circuit with o(n) ancillary qubits for any.e(n)=\omega(log* n). in particular, these methods yield efficient circuits with.depth o(log n) and with depth o(log* n), respectively. we apply our circuits to.constructing efficient quantum circuits for shor's discrete logarithm.algorithm.","['yasuhiro takahashi', 'seiichiro tani', 'noboru kunihiro']",quantum addition circuits and unbounded fan-out,http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.2530v1,2009

"given an undirected edge-weighted graph $g=(v,e)$ with $m$ edges and $n$.vertices, the minimum cut problem asks to find a subset of vertices $s$ such.that the total weight of all edges between $s$ and $v \setminus s$ is.minimized. karger's longstanding $o(m \log^3 n)$ time randomized algorithm for.this problem was very recently improved in two independent works to $o(m \log^2.n)$ [icalp'20] and to $o(m \log^2 n + n\log^5 n)$ [stoc'20]. these two.algorithms use different approaches and techniques. in particular, while the.former is faster, the latter has the advantage that it can be used to obtain.efficient algorithms in the cut-query and in the streaming models of.computation. in this paper, we show how to simplify and improve the algorithm.of [stoc'20] to $o(m \log^2 n + n\log^3 n)$. we obtain this by replacing a.randomized algorithm that, given a spanning tree $t$ of $g$, finds in $o(m \log.n+n\log^4 n)$ time a minimum cut of $g$ that 2-respects (cuts two edges of) $t$.with a simple $o(m \log n+n\log^2 n)$ time deterministic algorithm for the same.problem.","['paweł gawrychowski', 'shay mozes', 'oren weimann']",a note on a recent algorithm for minimum cut,http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02060v2,2020

[soda 2020] presented an.algorithm with the desired space usage of $o(n \textrm{polylog}(n))$, but a.worse approximation ratio of $6/11(\sim.545)$, or $3/5(=.6)$ in bipartite.graphs..  in this paper, we present an algorithm that computes a.$2/3(\sim.66)$-approximate matching using only $o(n \log(n))$ space, improving.upon both results above. we also note that for adversarial streams, a lower.bound of kapralov [soda 2013] shows that any algorithm that achieves a.$1-1/e(\sim.63)$-approximation requires $(n^{1+\omega(1/\log\log(n))})$ space..our result for random-order streams is the first to go beyond the.adversarial-order lower bound, thus establishing that computing a maximum.matching is provably easier in random-order streams.",['aaron bernstein'],improved bound for matching in random-order streams,http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00417v1,2020

"this paper initiates the study of i/o algorithms (minimizing cache misses).from the perspective of fine-grained complexity (conditional polynomial lower.bounds). specifically, we aim to answer why sparse graph problems are so hard,.and why the longest common subsequence problem gets a savings of a factor of.the size of cache times the length of a cache line, but no more. we take the.reductions and techniques from complexity and fine-grained complexity and apply.them to the i/o model to generate new (conditional) lower bounds as well as.faster algorithms. we also prove the existence of a time hierarchy for the i/o.model, which motivates the fine-grained reductions..  using fine-grained reductions, we give an algorithm for distinguishing 2 vs..3 diameter and radius that runs in $o(|e|^2/(mb))$ cache misses, which for.sparse graphs improves over the previous $o(|v|^2/b)$ running time. we give new.reductions from radius and diameter to wiener index and median. we show.meaningful reductions between problems that have linear-time solutions in the.ram model. the reductions use low i/o complexity (typically $o(n/b)$), and thus.help to finely capture the relationship between ""i/o linear time"" $\theta(n/b)$.and ram linear time $\theta(n)$. we generate new i/o assumptions based on the.difficulty of improving sparse graph problem running times in the i/o model. we.create conjectures that the current best known algorithms for single source.shortest paths (sssp), diameter, and radius are optimal. from these i/o-model.assumptions, we show that many of the known reductions in the word-ram model.can naturally extend to hold in the i/o model as well (e.g., a lower bound on.the i/o complexity of longest common subsequence that matches the best known.running time). finally, we prove an analog of the time hierarchy theorem in the.i/o model.","['erik d. demaine', 'andrea lincoln', 'quanquan c. liu', 'jayson lynch', 'virginia vassilevska williams']","fine-grained i/o complexity via reductions: new lower bounds, faster.  algorithms, and a time hierarchy",http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07960v3,2017

"in this work we present the first parameterizations of the global occurrence.rate and chemical influence of blue jets, a type of transient luminous event.(tle) taking place in the stratospheric region above thunderclouds. these.parameterizations are directly coupled with five different lightning.parameterizations implemented in the whole atmosphere community climate model.(waccm4). we have obtained a maximum blue jet global occurrence rate of about.0.9 bj per minute. the geographical occurrence of blue jets is closely related.to the chosen lightning parameterization. some previously developed local.chemical models of blue jets predicted an important influence onto the.stratospheric concentration of n$_2$o, no$_x$ and o$_3$. we have used these.results together with our global implementations of blue jets in waccm4 to.estimate their global chemical influence in the atmosphere. according to our.results, blue jets can inject about 3.8 tg n$_2$o-n yr$^{-1}$ and 0.07 tg no-n.yr$^{-1}$ near the stratosphere, where n$_2$o-n and no-n stand for the mass of.nitrogen atoms in n$_2$o and no molecules, respectively. these production rates.of n$_2$o and no$_x$ could have a direct impact on, for example, the acidity of.rainwater or the greenhouse effect. we have found that blue jets could also.slightly contribute to the depletion of stratospheric ozone. in particular, we.have estimated that the maximum difference in the concentration of o$_3$ at 30.km of altitude between simulations with and without blue jets can be about -5.\% in equatorial and polar regions.","['f. j. pérez-invernón', 'f. j. gordillo-vázquez', 'a. k. smith', 'e. arnone. h. winkler']",global occurrence and chemical impact of stratospheric blue jets modeled.  with waccm4,http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01232v1,2019
"this paper demonstrates the usefulness of distributed local verification of.proofs, as a tool for the design of self-stabilizing algorithms.in particular,.it introduces a somewhat generalized notion of distributed local proofs, and.utilizes it for improving the time complexity significantly, while maintaining.space optimality. as a result, we show that optimizing the memory size carries.at most a small cost in terms of time, in the context of minimum spanning tree.(mst). that is, we present algorithms that are both time and space efficient.for both constructing an mst and for verifying it.this involves several parts.that may be considered contributions in themselves.first, we generalize the.notion of local proofs, trading off the time complexity for memory efficiency..this adds a dimension to the study of distributed local proofs, which has been.gaining attention recently. specifically, we design a (self-stabilizing) proof.labeling scheme which is memory optimal (i.e., $o(\log n)$ bits per node), and.whose time complexity is $o(\log ^2 n)$ in synchronous networks, or $o(\delta.\log ^3 n)$ time in asynchronous ones, where $\delta$ is the maximum degree of.nodes. this answers an open problem posed by awerbuch and varghese (focs 1991)..we also show that $\omega(\log n)$ time is necessary, even in synchronous.networks. another property is that if $f$ faults occurred, then, within the.requireddetection time above, they are detected by some node in the $o(f\log.n)$ locality of each of the faults.second, we show how to enhance a known.transformer that makes input/output algorithms self-stabilizing. it now takes.as input an efficient construction algorithm and an efficient self-stabilizing.proof labeling scheme, and produces an efficient self-stabilizing algorithm..when used for mst, the transformer produces a memory optimal self-stabilizing.algorithm, whose time complexity, namely, $o(n)$, is significantly better even.than that of previous algorithms. (the time complexity of previous mst.algorithms that used $\omega(\log^2 n)$ memory bits per node was $o(n^2)$, and.the time for optimal space algorithms was $o(n|e|)$.) inherited from our proof.labelling scheme, our self-stabilising mst construction algorithm also has the.following two properties: (1) if faults occur after the construction ended,.then they are detected by some nodes within $o(\log ^2 n)$ time in synchronous.networks, or within $o(\delta \log ^3 n)$ time in asynchronous ones, and (2) if.$f$ faults occurred, then, within the required detection time above, they are.detected within the $o(f\log n)$ locality of each of the faults. we also show.how to improve the above two properties, at the expense of some increase in the.memory.","['amos korman', 'shay kutten', 'toshimitsu masuzawa']","fast and compact self-stabilizing verification, computation, and fault.  detection of an mst",http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07800v1,2015

"(abridged) the chemical composition of planetary atmospheres has long been.thought to store information regarding where and when a planet accretes its.material. predicting this chemical composition theoretically is a crucial step.in linking observational studies to the underlying physics that govern planet.formation. as a follow-up to a study of hot jupiters in our previous work, we.present a population of warm jupiters (semi-major axis between 0.5-4 au).extracted from the same planetesimal formation population synthesis model as.used in our previous work. we compute the astrochemical evolution of the.protoplanetary disks included in this population to predict the.carbon-to-oxygen (c/o) and nitrogen-to-oxygen (n/o) ratio evolution of the disk.gas, ice, and refractory sources, the accretion of which greatly impacts the.resulting c/o and n/o in the atmosphere of giant planets. we confirm that the.main sequence (between accreted solid mass and atmospheric c/o) we found.previously is largely reproduced by the presented population of synthetic warm.jupiters. and as a result, the majority of the population fall along the.empirically derived mass-metallicity relation when the natal disk has solar or.lower metallicity. planets forming from disks with high metallicity ([fe/h] $>$.0.1) result in more scatter in chemical properties which could explain some of.the scatter found in the mass-metallicity relation. combining predicted c/o and.n/o ratios shows that jupiter does not fall among our population of synthetic.planets, suggesting that it likely did not form in the inner 5 au of the solar.system before proceeding into a grand tack. this result is consistent with.recent analysis of the chemical composition of jupiter's atmosphere which.suggests that it accreted most of its heavy element abundance farther than tens.of au away from the sun.","['alex j. cridland', 'ewine f. van dishoeck', 'matthew alessi', 'ralph e. pudritz']",connecting planet formation and astrochemistry: c/o and n/o of warm.  giant planets and jupiter-analogs,http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02907v1,2020
"we consider an asynchronous voting process on graphs which we call discordant.voting, and which can be described as follows. initially each vertex holds one.of two opinions, red or blue say. neighbouring vertices with different opinions.interact pairwise. after an interaction both vertices have the same colour. the.quantity of interest is t, the time to reach consensus , i.e. the number of.interactions needed for all vertices have the same colour..  an edge whose endpoint colours differ (i.e. one vertex is coloured red and.the other one blue) is said to be discordant. a vertex is discordant if its is.incident with a discordant edge. in discordant voting, all interactions are.based on discordant edges. because the voting process is asynchronous there are.several ways to update the colours of the interacting vertices. push: pick a.random discordant vertex and push its colour to a random discordant neighbour..pull: pick a random discordant vertex and pull the colour of a random.discordant neighbour. oblivious: pick a random endpoint of a random discordant.edge and push the colour to the other end point..  we show that e(t), the expected time to reach consensus, depends strongly on.the underlying graph and the update rule. for connected graphs on n vertices,.and an initial half red, half blue colouring the following hold. for oblivious.voting, e(t) =n^2/4 independent of the underlying graph. for the complete graph.k_n, the push protocol has e(t)= theta(n log(n)), whereas the pull protocol has.e(t)= theta(2^n). for the cycle c_n all three protocols have e(t) = theta(n^2)..for the star graph however, the pull protocol has e(t)=o(n^2), whereas the push.protocol is slower with e(t) = theta(n^2 log(n))..  the wide variation in e(t) for the pull protocol is to be contrasted with the.well known model of synchronous pull voting, for which e(t) = o(n) on many.classes of expanders.","['colin cooper', 'martin dyer', 'alan frieze', 'nicolas rivera']",discordant voting processes on finite graphs,http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06884v3,2016

the present paper studies the symmeries of the hubbard model of electrons.with generally $n$-fold orbital degeneracy. it's shown su_d(2n) and su_c(2n).symmetries hold respectively for the model with completely repulsive or.attractive on-site interaction and that with partly attractive interactions. an.extended lieb-mattis transformation is given to map these two symmetries into.each other. the sub-symmetry su_d^{(e)}(n)\otimes su_d^{(o)}(n) is found to be.shared by the two models with arbitrary chemical potential \mu. by assuming at.most two electrons on each site it's found that $su_d(2n)$ and $su_c(2n)$ both.exist in each kind of the two models and consequently lead to a larger symmetry.su_d(2n)\times su_c(2n). another underlying symmetry su_c^{(e)}(2)_{{\cal.p}}\times ...\times su_c^{(e)}(2)_{{\cal p}} \otimes \bigl(su_c^{(o)}(2)_{{\cal.p}}\times ...\times su_c^{(o)}(2)_{{\cal p}}\bigr) is also revealed for the.unified $u$ model under the excluding. the symmetry is valid for the partially.attractive model with chemical potential $\mu =-u.$,"['zu-jian ying', 'you-quan li', 'shi-jian gu']",symmetries in the hubbard model with n-fold orbital degeneracy,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0102211v1,2001

"this paper addresses the cornerstone family of \emph{local problems} in.distributed computing, and investigates the curious gap between randomized and.deterministic solutions under bandwidth restrictions..  our main contribution is in providing tools for derandomizing solutions to.local problems, when the $n$ nodes can only send $o(\log n)$-bit messages in.each round of communication. we combine bounded independence, which we show to.be sufficient for some algorithms, with the method of conditional expectations.and with additional machinery, to obtain the following results..  our techniques give a deterministic maximal independent set (mis) algorithm.in the congest model, where the communication graph is identical to the input.graph, in $o(d\log^2 n)$ rounds, where $d$ is the diameter of the graph. the.best known running time in terms of $n$ alone is $2^{o(\sqrt{\log n})}$, which.is super-polylogarithmic, and requires large messages. for the congest model,.the only known previous solution is a coloring-based $o(\delta + \log^*.n)$-round algorithm, where $\delta$ is the maximal degree in the graph..  on the way to obtaining the above, we show that in the \emph{congested.clique} model, which allows all-to-all communication, there is a deterministic.mis algorithm that runs in $o(\log \delta \log n)$ rounds.%, where $\delta$ is.the maximum degree. when $\delta=o(n^{1/3})$, the bound improves to $o(\log.\delta)$ and holds also for $(\delta+1)$-coloring..  in addition, we deterministically construct a $(2k-1)$-spanner with.$o(kn^{1+1/k}\log n)$ edges in $o(k \log n)$ rounds. for comparison, in the.more stringent congest model, the best deterministic algorithm for constructing.a $(2k-1)$-spanner with $o(kn^{1+1/k})$ edges runs in $o(n^{1-1/k})$ rounds.","['keren censor-hillel', 'merav parter', 'gregory schwartzman']",derandomizing local distributed algorithms under bandwidth restrictions,http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01689v1,2016

"we consider the initial value problem for the generalized allen-cahn.equation, \[\partial_t \phi = \delta \phi-\varepsilon^{-2} \phi (\phi^t \phi -.i), \qquad x \in \omega, \ t\geq 0,\] where $\phi$ is an $n\times n$ real.matrix-valued field, $\omega$ is a two-dimensional square with periodic.boundary conditions, and $\varepsilon > 0$. this equation is the gradient flow.for the energy, $e(\phi) := \int \frac{1}{2} \|\nabla \phi \|^2_f+\frac{1}{4.\varepsilon^2} \| \phi^t \phi - i \|^2_f$, where $\| \cdot \|_f$ denotes the.frobenius norm. the primary contribution of this paper is to use asymptotic.methods to describe the solution of this initial value problem. if the initial.condition has single-signed determinant, at each point of the domain, at a fast.$o(\varepsilon^{-2} t)$ time scale, the solution evolves towards the closest.orthogonal matrix. then, at the $o(t)$ time scale, the solution evolves.according to the $o_n$ diffusion equation. stationary solutions to the $o_n$.diffusion equation are analyzed for $n=2$. if the initial condition has regions.where the determinant is positive and negative, a free interface develops. away.from the interface, in each region, the matrix-valued field behaves as in the.single-signed determinant case. at the $o(t)$ time scale, the interface evolves.in the normal direction by curvature. at a slow $o(\varepsilon t)$ time scale,.the interface is driven by curvature and the surface diffusion of the.matrix-valued field. for $n=2$, the interface is driven by curvature and the.jump in the squared tangental derivative of the phase across the interface. in.particular, we emphasize that the interface when $n\geq 2$ is driven by surface.diffusion, while for $n=1$, the original allen--cahn equation, the interface is.only driven by mean curvature. a variety of numerical experiments are performed.to verify, support, and illustrate our analytical results.","['dong wang', 'braxton osting', 'xiao-ping wang']",interface dynamics for an allen-cahn-type equation governing a.  matrix-valued field,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05985v1,2019

"in 2011, anderson and frazier define the concept of.$\tau_{(n)}$-factorization, where $\tau_{(n)}$ is a restriction of the modulo.$n$ equivalence relation. these relations have been worked mostly for small.values of $n$. however, it is sometimes difficult to extend findings to larger.values of $n$. one of these problems is finding $\tau_{(n)}$-irreducible.elements or $\tau_{(n)}$-atoms in order to characterize elements that have a.$\tau_{(n)}$-factorization in $\tau_{(n)}$-atoms. the $\tau_{(n)}$-irreducible.elements are well known for $n=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10,12$. however, the problem of.determining the $\tau_{(n)}$-atoms becomes much more difficult the larger $n$.is. in this work, we present an algorithm to construct families of.$\tau_{(n)}$-atoms. it is shown that the algorithm terminates in finitely many.steps when $n$ is the safe prime associated to a sophie germain prime.","['andré hernández-espiet', 'reyes m. ortiz-albino']",on the characterization of $τ_{(n)}$-atoms,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02834v1,2019
"we explore properties of core-collapse supernova progenitors with respect to.the composite uncertainties in the thermonuclear reaction rates by coupling the.reaction rate probability density functions provided by the starlib reaction.rate library with $\texttt{mesa}$ stellar models. we evolve 1000 15 $m_{\odot}$.models from the pre main-sequence to core o-depletion at solar and subsolar.metallicities for a total of 2000 monte carlo stellar models. for each stellar.model, we independently and simultaneously sample 665 thermonuclear reaction.rates and use them in a $\texttt{mesa}$ in situ reaction network that follows.127 isotopes from $^{1}$h to $^{64}$zn. with this framework we survey the core.mass, burning lifetime, composition, and structural properties at five.different evolutionary epochs. at each epoch we measure the probability.distribution function of the variations of each property and calculate spearman.rank-order correlation coefficients for each sampled reaction rate to identify.which reaction rate has the largest impact on the variations on each property..we find that uncertainties in $^{14}$n$(p,\gamma)^{15}$o, triple-$\alpha$,.$^{12}$c$(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}$o, $^{12}$c($^{12}$c,$p$)$^{23}$na,.$^{12}$c($^{16}$o,$p$)$^{27}$al, $^{16}$o($^{16}$o,$n$)$^{31}$s,.$^{16}$o($^{16}$o,$p$)$^{31}$p, and $^{16}$o($^{16}$o,$\alpha$)$^{28}$si.reaction rates dominate the variations of the properties surveyed. we find that.variations induced by uncertainties in nuclear reaction rates grow with each.passing phase of evolution, and at core h-, he-depletion are of comparable.magnitude to the variations induced by choices of mass resolution and network.resolution. however, at core c-, ne-, and o-depletion, the reaction rate.uncertainties can dominate the variation causing uncertainty in various.properties of the stellar model in the evolution towards iron core-collapse.","['c. e. fields', 'f. x. timmes', 'r. farmer', 'i. petermann', 'william m. wolf', 's. m. couch']",the impact of nuclear reaction rate uncertainties on the evolution of.  core-collapse supernova progenitors,http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06057v1,2017
"let $g=(v,e)$ be an $n$-vertex directed acyclic graph (dag). a lowest common.ancestor (lca) of two vertices $u$ and $v$ is a common ancestor $w$ of $u$ and.$v$ such that no descendant of $w$ has the same property. in this paper, we.consider the problem of computing an lca, if any, for all pairs of vertices in.a dag. the fastest known algorithms for this problem exploit fast matrix.multiplication subroutines and have running times ranging from $o(n^{2.687})$.[bender et al.~soda'01] down to $o(n^{2.615})$ [kowaluk and lingas~icalp'05].and $o(n^{2.569})$ [czumaj et al.~tcs'07]. somewhat surprisingly, all those.bounds would still be $\omega(n^{2.5})$ even if matrix multiplication could be.solved optimally (i.e., $\omega=2$). this appears to be an inherent barrier for.all the currently known approaches, which raises the natural question on.whether one could break through the $o(n^{2.5})$ barrier for this problem..  in this paper, we answer this question affirmatively: in particular, we.present an $\tilde o(n^{2.447})$ ($\tilde o(n^{7/3})$ for $\omega=2$) algorithm.for finding an lca for all pairs of vertices in a dag, which represents the.first improvement on the running times for this problem in the last 13 years. a.key tool in our approach is a fast algorithm to partition the vertex set of the.transitive closure of $g$ into a collection of $o(\ell)$ chains and $o(n/\ell)$.antichains, for a given parameter $\ell$. as usual, a chain is a path while an.antichain is an independent set. we then find, for all pairs of vertices, a.\emph{candidate} lca among the chain and antichain vertices, separately. the.first set is obtained via a reduction to min-max matrix multiplication. the.computation of the second set can be reduced to boolean matrix multiplication.similarly to previous results on this problem. we finally combine the two.solutions together in a careful (non-obvious) manner.","['fabrizio grandoni', 'giuseppe f. italiano', 'aleksander łukasiewicz', 'nikos parotsidis', 'przemysław uznański']",all-pairs lca in dags: breaking through the $o(n^{2.5})$ barrier,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08914v2,2020

"resonant structures in $b^0\to\psi'\pi^-k^+$ decays are analyzed by.performing a four-dimensional fit of the decay amplitude, using $pp$ collision.data corresponding to $\rm 3 fb^{-1}$ collected with the lhcb detector. the.data cannot be described with $k^+\pi^-$ resonances alone, which is confirmed.with a model-independent approach. a highly significant.$z(4430)^-\to\psi'\pi^-$ component is required, thus confirming the existence.of this state. the observed evolution of the $z(4430)^-$ amplitude with the.$\psi'\pi^-$ mass establishes the resonant nature of this particle. the mass.and

"this is a short summary of the phase structure of vector o(n) symmetric.quantum field theories in a singular limit, the double scaling limit.it is.motivated by the fact that summing up dynamically triangulated random surfaces.using feynman graphs of the o(n) matrix model results in a genus expansion and.it provides,in some sense, a nonperturbative treatment of string theory when.the double scaling limit is enforced. the main point emphasized here is that.this formal singular limit, recently discussed mainly in d=0 o(n) matrix.models, has an intriguing physical meaning in d>2 o(n) vector theories. in this.limit all orders in {1\over n} are of equal importance since at each order.infrared divergences compensate for the decrease in powers of {1\over n}. the.infrared divergences are due to the tuning of the strength of the force {g \to.g_c} between the o(n) quanta so that a massless o(n) singlet appears in the.spectrum. at the critical dimension an interesting phase structure is revealed,.the massless excitation has the expected physical meaning: it is the goldston.boson of spontaneous breaking of scale invariance - the dilaton.",['moshe moshe'],quantum field theory in singular limits,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9812029v1,1998

"decays of bs and b0 mesons into j/\psi \pi +\pi -\pi +\pi - final states,.produced in pp collisions at the lhc, are investigated using data corresponding.to an integrated luminosity of 3/fb collected with the lhcb detector. b^0_(s).-> j\psi f_1(1285) decays are seen for the first time, and the branching.fractions are measured. using these rates, the f_1(1285) mixing angle between.strange and

"we study budget constrained network upgradeable problems. we are given an.undirected edge weighted graph $g=(v,e)$ where the weight an edge $e \in e$ can.be upgraded for a cost $c(e)$. given a budget $b$ for improvement, the goal is.to find a subset of edges to be upgraded so that the resulting network is.optimum for $b$. the results obtained in this paper include the following..  maximum weight constrained spanning tree.  we present a randomized algorithm for the problem of weight upgradeable.budget constrained maximum spanning tree on a general graph. this returns a.spanning tree $\mathcal{t}^{'}$ which is feasible within the budget $b$, such.that $\pr [ l(\mathcal{t}^{'}) \geq (1-\epsilon)\text{opt}\text{ , }.c(\mathcal{t}^{'} ) \leq b] \ge 1-\frac{1}{n}$ (where $l$ and $c$ denote the.length and cost of the tree respectively), for any fixed $\epsilon >0$, in time.polynomial in $|v|=n$, $|e|=m$. our results extend to the minimization version.also. previously krumke et. al. \cite{krumke} presented a$(1+\frac{1}{\gamma},.1+ \gamma)$ bicriteria approximation algorithm for any fixed $\gamma >0$ for.this problem in general graphs for a more general cost upgrade function. the.result in this paper improves their 0/1 cost upgrade model..  longest path in a dag we consider the problem of weight improvable longest.path in a $n$ vertex dag and give a $o(n^3)$ algorithm for the problem when.there is a bound on the number of improvements allowed. we also give a.$(1-\epsilon)$-approximation which runs in $o(\frac{n^4}{\epsilon})$ time for.the budget constrained version. similar results can be achieved also for the.problem of shortest paths in a dag.","['debjyoti saharoy', 'sandeep sen']",approximation algorithms for budget constrained network upgradeable.  problems,http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3721v1,2014

"the resonant structure of the decay $\overline{b}_s^0\to j/\psi\pi^+\pi^-$ is.studied using data corresponding to 3 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity from.$pp$ collisions by the lhc and collected by the lhcb detector. five interfering.$\pi^+\pi^-$ states are required to describe the decay:.$f_0(980),f_0(1500),f_0(1790),f_2(1270)$, and $f_2^{\prime}(1525)$. an.alternative model including these states and a non-resonant $j/\psi \pi^+\pi^-$.component also provides a good description of the data. based on the different.transversity components measured for the spin-2 intermediate states, the final.state is found to be compatible with being entirely $cp$-odd. the $cp$-even.part is found to be $<2.3$% at 95% confidence level. the $f_0(500)$ state is.not observed, allowing a limit to be set on the absolute value of the mixing.angle with the $f_0(980)$ of $<7.7^{\circ}$ at 90% confidence level, consistent.with a tetraquark interpretation of the $f_0(980)$ substructure.","[' lhcb

"charged particle multiplicities are studied in proton-proton collisions in.the forward region at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 7\;$tev with data.collected by the lhcb detector. the forward spectrometer allows access to a.kinematic range of $2.0<\eta<4.8$ in pseudorapidity, momenta down to.$2\;$gev/$c$ and transverse momenta down to $0.2\;$gev/$c$. the measurements.are performed using minimum-bias events with at least one charged particle in.the kinematic acceptance. the results are presented as functions of.pseudorapidity and transverse momentum and are compared to predictions

"by performing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first-principles.calculations, we address the topological phase of caagp and investigate the.topological phase transition in caag(p1-xasx). we reveal that in caagp, the.bulk band gap and surface states with a large bandwidth are topologically.trivial, in agreement with hybrid density functional theory calculations. the.calculations also indicate that application of ""negative"" hydrostatic pressure.can transform trivial semiconducting caagp into an ideal topological nodal-line.semimetal phase. the topological transition can be realized by partial.isovalent p/as substitution at x = 0.38.","['n. xu', 'y. t. qian', 'q. s. wu', 'g. autes', 'c. e. matt', 'b. q. lv', 'm. y. yao', 'v. n. strocov', 'e. pomjakushina', 'k. conder', 'n. c. plumb', 'm. radovic', 'o. v. yazyev', 't. qian', 'h. ding', 'j. mesot', 'm. shi']",trivial topological phase of caagp and the topological nodal-line.  transition in caag(p1-xasx),http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.09327v1,2018
"spin-flop transition (sft) consists in a jump-like reversal of.antiferromagnetic magnetic moments into a non-collinear state when the magnetic.field increases above the critical value. potentially the sft can be utilized.in many applications of a rapidly developing antiferromagnetic spintronics..however, the difficulty of using them in conventional antiferromagnets lies in.(a) too large switching magnetic fields (b) the need for presence of a magnetic.anisotropy, and (c) requirement to apply magnetic field along the correspondent.anisotropy axis. in this work we propose to use artificial ferrimagnets in.which the spin-flop transition occurs without anisotropy and the transition.field can be lowered by adjusting exchange coupling in the structure. this is.proved by experiment on artificial fe-gd ferrimagnets where usage of pd spacers.allowed us to suppress the transition field by two orders of magnitude.","['n. o. antropov', 'e. a. kravtsov', 'm. v. makarova', 'v. v. proglyado', 't. keller', 'i. a. subbotin', 'e. m. pashaev', 'g. v. prutskov', 'a. l. vasiliev', 'yu. m. chesnokov', 'n. g. bebenin', 'v. v. ustinov', 'b. keimer', 'yu. n. khaydukov']",tunable spin-flop transition in artificial ferrimagnets,http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.06155v1,2021

"the production of $j/\psi$ mesons with rapidity $1.5<y<4.0$ or $-5.0<y<-2.5$.and transverse momentum $p_\mathrm{t}<14 \mathrm{gev}/c$ is studied with the.lhcb detector in proton-lead collisions at a nucleon-nucleon centre-of-mass.energy $\sqrt{s_{nn}}=5 \mathrm{tev}$. the analysis is based on a data sample.corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about $1.6 \mathrm{nb}^{-1}$. for.the first time the nuclear modification factor and forward-backward production.ratio are determined separately for prompt $j/\psi$ mesons and $j/\psi$ from.$b$-hadron decays. clear suppression of prompt $j/\psi$ production with respect.to proton-proton collisions at large rapidity is observed, while the production.of $j/\psi$ from $b$-hadron decays is less suppressed. these results show good.agreement with available theoretical predictions. the measurement shows that.cold nuclear matter effects are important for interpretations of the related.quark-gluon plasma signatures in heavy-ion collisions.","[' lhcb collaboration', 'r. aaij', 'b. adeva', 'm. adinolfi', 'c. adrover', 'a. affolder', 'z. ajaltouni', 'j. albrecht', 'f. alessio', 'm. alexander', 's. ali', 'g. alkhazov',

"measurements of charm mixing parameters from the decay-time-dependent ratio.of d0->k+pi- to d0->k-pi+ rates and the charge-conjugate ratio are reported..the analysis uses data, corresponding to 3 fb^{-1} of integrated luminosity,.from proton-proton collisions at 7 and 8 tev center-of-mass energies recorded.by the lhcb experiment. in the limit of charge-parity (cp) symmetry, the mixing.parameters are determined to be x'^2=(5.5 +- 4.9)x10^{-5}, y'= (4.8 +-.1.0)x10^{-3}, and r_d=(3.568 +- 0.066)x10^{-3}. allowing for cp violation, the.mixing parameters are determined separately for d0 and d0bar mesons yielding.a_d = (-0.7 +- 1.9)%, for the direct cp-violating asymmetry, and 0.75 < |q/p|<.1.24 at the 68.3% confidence level, where q and p are parameters that describe.the mass eigenstates of the neutral charm mesons in terms of the flavor.eigenstates. this is the most precise determination of these parameters from a.single experiment and shows no evidence for cp violation.","[' lhcb collaboration', 'r. aaij', 'b. adeva', 'm. adinolfi', 'c. adrover', 'a. affolder', 'z. ajaltouni', 'j. albrecht', 'f. alessio', 'm. alexander', 's. ali', 'g. alkhazov', 'p.

"a study of indirect cp violation in $d^0$ mesons through the determination of.the parameter $a_\gamma$ is presented using a data sample of $pp$ collisions,.corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.0 fb$^{-1}$, collected with the.lhcb detector and recorded at the centre-of-mass energy of 7 tev at the lhc..the parameter $a_\gamma$ is the asymmetry of the effective lifetimes measured.in decays of $d^0$ and $\bar{d}^0$ mesons to the cp eigenstates $k^-k^+$ and.$\pi^-\pi^+$. fits to the data sample yield.$a_\gamma(kk)=(-0.35\pm0.62\pm0.12)\times 10^{-3}$ and.$a_\gamma(\pi\pi)=(0.33\pm1.06\pm0.14)\times 10^{-3}$, where the first.uncertainties are statistical and the second systematic. the results represent.the world's best measurements of these quantities. they show no difference in.$a_\gamma$ between the two final states and no indication of cp violation.","[' lhcb collaboration', 'r. aaij', 'b. adeva', 'm. adinolfi', 'c. adrover', 'a.

"we study the thermodynamics of the relativistic quantum o($n$) model in two.space dimensions. in the vicinity of the zero-temperature quantum critical.point (qcp), the pressure can be written in the scaling form.$p(t)=p(0)+n(t^3/c^2)\calf_n(\delta/t)$ where $c$ is the velocity of the.excitations at the qcp and $\delta$ is a characteristic zero-temperature energy.scale. using both a large-$n$ approach to leading order and the nonperturbative.renormalization group, we compute the universal scaling function $\calf_n$. for.small values of $n$ ($n\lesssim 10$) we find that $\calf_n(x)$ is nonmonotonous.in the quantum critical regime ($|x|\lesssim 1$) with a maximum near $x=0$. the.large-$n$ approach -- if properly interpreted -- is a good approximation both.in the renormalized classical ($x\lesssim -1$) and quantum disordered.($x\gtrsim 1$) regimes, but fails to describe the nonmonotonous behavior of.$\calf_n$ in the quantum critical regime. we discuss the renormalization-group.flows in the various regimes near the qcp and make the connection with the.quantum nonlinear sigma model in the renormalized classical regime. we compute.the berezinskii-kosterlitz-thouless transition temperature in the quantum o(2).model and find that in the vicinity of the qcp the universal ratio.$\tkt/\rho_s(0)$ is very close to $\pi/2$, implying that the stiffness.$\rho_s(\tkt^-)$ at the transition is only slightly reduced with respect to the.zero-temperature stiffness $\rho_s(0)$. finally, we briefly discuss the.experimental determination of the universal function $\calf_2$ from the.pressure of a bose gas in an optical lattice near the.superfluid--mott-insulator transition.","['a. rancon', 'o. kodio', 'n. dupuis', 'p. lecheminant']",thermodynamics in the vicinity of a relativistic quantum critical point.  in 2+1 dimensions,http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.6559v2,2013

"in this paper, we study the discrete logarithm problem in the finite fields.$\f_{q^n}$ where $n|q-1$. the field is called a kummer field or a kummer.extension of $\f_q$. it plays an important role in improving the aks primality.proving algorithm. it is known that we can efficiently construct an element $g$.with order greater than $2^n$ in the fields. let $s_q(\bullet)$ be the function.from integers to the sum of digits in their $q$-ary expansions. we present an.algorithm that given $g^e$ ($ 0\leq e < q^n $) finds $e$ in random polynomial.time, provided that $s_q (e) < n$. we then show that the problem is solvable in.random polynomial time for most of the exponent $e$ with $s_q (e) < 1.32 n $..the main tool for the latter result is the guruswami-sudan list decoding.algorithm. built on these results, we prove that in the field $\f_{q^{q-1}}$,.the bounded sum-of-digits discrete logarithm with respect to $g$ can be.computed in random time $o(f(w) \log^4 (q^{q-1}))$, where $f$ is a.subexponential function and $w$ is the bound on the $q$-ary sum-of-digits of.the exponent. hence the problem is fixed parameter tractable. these results are.shown to be extendible to artin-schreier extension $\f_{p^p}$ where $p$ is a.prime. since every finite field has an extension of reasonable degree which is.a kummer field, our result reveals an unexpected property of the discrete.logarithm problem, namely, the bounded sum-of-digits discrete logarithm problem.in any given finite field becomes polynomial time solvable in certain low.degree extensions.",['qi cheng'],on the bounded sum-of-digits discrete logarithm problem in kummer and.  artin-schreier extensions,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0311120v1,2003

"the hot wn star wr2 (hd6327) has been claimed to have many singular.characteristics. to explain its unusually rounded and relatively weak emission.line profiles, it has been proposed that wr2 is rotating close to break-up with.a magnetically confined wind. alternatively, the line profiles could be.explained by the dilution of wr2's spectrum by that of a companion. in this.paper, we present a study of wr2 using near-infrared ao imaging and optical.spectroscopy and polarimetry. our spectra reveal the presence of weak.photospheric absorption lines from a ~b2.5-4v companion, which however.contributes only ~5-10% to the total light, suggesting that the companion is a.background object. therefore, its flux cannot be causing any significant.dilution of the wr star's emission lines. the absence of intrinsic linear.continuum polarization from wr2 does not support the proposed fast rotation..our stokes v spectrum was not of sufficient quality to test the presence of a.moderately strong organized magnetic field but our new modelling indicates that.to confine the wind the putative magnetic field must be significantly stronger.than was previously suggested sufficiently strong as to make its presence.implausible.","['a. -n. chené', 'n. st-louis', 'a. f. j. moffat', 'o. schnurr', 'p. a. crowther', 'g. a. wade', 'n. d. richardson', 'c. baranec', 'c. a. ziegler', 'n. m. law', 'r. riddle', 'g. a. rate', 'é. artigau', 'e. alecian', 'binamics collaboration']",investigating the origin of the spectral line profiles of the hot.  wolf-rayet star wr2,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05815v1,2019

"a broad peaking structure is observed in the dimuon spectrum of $b^+ \to k^+.\mu^+\mu^-$ decays in the kinematic region where the kaon has a low recoil.against the dimuon system. the structure is consistent with interference.between the $b^+ \to k^+ \mu^+\mu^-$ decay and a resonance and has a.statistical significance exceeding six standard deviations. the mean and width.of the resonance are measured to be $4191^{+9}_{-8}\mathrm{\,me\kern -0.1em.v/}c^2$ and $65^{+22}_{-16}\mathrm{\,me\kern -0.1em v/}c^2$, respectively,.where the uncertainties include statistical and systematic

"a measurement of the $c\p$ asymmetry in $b^+ \rightarrow k^+ \mu^+ \mu^-$.decays is presented using $pp$ collision data, corresponding to an integrated.luminosity of 1.0${\,fb}^{-1}$, recorded by the lhcb experiment during 2011 at.a centre-of-mass energy of 7 tev. the measurement is performed in seven bins of.$\mu^+ \mu^-$ invariant mass squared in the range.${0.05<q^{2}<22.00{\mathrm{gev^2/}c^4}}$, excluding the ${j/\psi}$ and.$\psi{(2s)}$ resonance regions. production and detection asymmetries are.corrected for using the $b^+ \rightarrow j/\psi

"the ship experiment is designed to search for very weakly interacting.particles beyond the standard model which are produced in a 400 gev/c proton.beam dump at the cern sps. an essential task for the experiment is to keep the.standard model background level to less than 0.1 event after $2\times 10^{20}$.protons on target. in the beam dump, around $10^{11}$ muons will be produced.per second. the muon rate in the spectrometer has to be reduced by at least.four orders of magnitude to avoid muon-induced combinatorial background. a.novel active muon shield is used to magnetically deflect the muons out of the.acceptance of the spectrometer. this paper describes the basic principle of.such a shield, its optimization and its performance.","[' ship collaboration', 'a. akmete', 'a. alexandrov', 'a. anokhina', 's. aoki', 'e. atkin', 'n. azorskiy', 'j. j. back', 'a. bagulya', 'a. baranov', 'g. j. barker', 'a. bay', 'v. bayliss', 'g. bencivenni', 'a. y. berdnikov', 'y. a. berdnikov', 'm. bertani', 'c. betancourt', 'i. bezshyiko', 'o. bezshyyko', 'd. bick', 's. bieschke', 'a. blanco', 'j. boehm', 'm. bogomilov', 'k. bondarenko', 'w. m. bonivento', 'a. boyarsky', 'r. brenner', 'd. breton', 'r. brundler', 'm. bruschi', 'v. büscher', 'a. buonaura', 's. buontempo', 's. cadeddu', 'a. calcaterra', 'm. campanelli', 'j. chauveau', 'a. chepurnov', 'm. chernyavsky', 'k. -y. choi', 'a. chumakov', 'p. ciambrone', 'g. m. dallavalle', ""n. d'ambrosio"", ""g. d'appollonio"", 'g. de lellis', 'a. de roeck', 'm. de serio', 'l. dedenko', 'a. di crescenzo', 'n. di marco', 'c. dib', 'h. dijkstra', 'v. dmitrenko', 'd. domenici', 's. donskov', 'a. dubreuil', 'j. ebert', 't. enik', 'a. etenko', 'f. fabbri', 'l. fabbri', 'o. fedin', 'g. fedorova', 'g. felici', 'm. ferro-luzzi', 'r. a. fini', 'p. fonte', 'c. franco', 't. fukuda', 'g. galati', 'g. gavrilov', 's. gerlach', 'l. golinka-bezshyyko', 'd. golubkov', 'a. golutvin', 'd. gorbunov', 's. gorbunov', 'v. gorkavenko', 'y. gornushkin', 'm. gorshenkov', 'v. grachev', 'e. graverini', 'v. grichine', 'a. m. guler', 'yu. guz', 'c. hagner', 'h. hakobyan', 'e. van herwijnen', 'a. hollnagel', 'b. hosseini', 'm. hushchyn', 'g. iaselli', 'a. iuliano', 'r. jacobsson', 'm. jonker', 'i. kadenko', 'c. kamiscioglu', 'm. kamiscioglu', 'm. khabibullin', 'g. khaustov', 'a. khotyantsev', 's. h. kim', 'v. kim', 'y. g. kim', 'n. kitagawa', 'j. -w. ko', 'k. kodama', 'a. kolesnikov', 'd. i. kolev', 'v. kolosov', 'm. komatsu', 'n. konovalova', 'm. a. korkmaz', 'i. korol', ""i. korol'ko"", 'a. korzenev', 's. kovalenko', 'i. krasilnikova', 'k. krivova', 'y. kudenko', 'v. kurochka', 'e. kuznetsova', 'h. m. lacker', 'a. lai', 'g. lanfranchi', 'o. lantwin', 'a. lauria', 'h. lebbolo', 'k. y. lee', 'j. -m. lévy', 'v. likacheva', 'l. lopes', 'v. lyubovitskij', 'j. maalmi', 'a. magnan', 'v. maleev', 'a. malinin', 'a. mefodev', 'p. mermod', 's. mikado', 'yu. mikhaylov', 'd. a. milstead', 'o. mineev', 'a. montanari', 'm. c. montesi', 'k. morishima', 's. movchan', 'n. naganawa', 'm. nakamura', 't. nakano', 'a. novikov', 'b. obinyakov', 's. ogawa', 'n. okateva', 'p. h. owen', 'a. paoloni', 'b. d. park', 'l. paparella', 'a. pastore', 'm. patel', 'd. pereyma', 'd. petrenko', 'k. petridis', 'd. podgrudkov', 'v. poliakov', 'n. polukhina', 'm. prokudin', 'a. prota', 'a. rademakers', 'f. ratnikov', 't. rawlings', 'm. razeti', 'f. redi', 's. ricciardi', 't. roganova', 'a. rogozhnikov', 'h. rokujo', 'g. rosa', 't. rovelli', 'o. ruchayskiy', 't. ruf', 'v. samoylenko', 'a. saputi', 'o. sato', 'e. s. savchenko', 'w. schmidt-parzefall', 'n. serra', 'a. shakin', 'm. shaposhnikov', 'p. shatalov', 't. shchedrina', 'l. shchutska', 'v. shevchenko', 'h. shibuya', 'a. shustov', 's. b. silverstein', 's. simone', 'm. skorokhvatov', 's. smirnov', 'j. y. sohn', 'a. sokolenko', 'n. starkov', 'b. storaci', 'p. strolin', 's. takahashi', 'i. timiryasov', 'v. tioukov', 'n. tosi', 'd. treille', 'r. tsenov', 's. ulin', 'a. ustyuzhanin', 'z. uteshev', 'g. vankova-kirilova', 'f. vannucci', 'p. venkova', 's. vilchinski', 'm. villa', 'k. vlasik', 'a. volkov', 'r. voronkov', 'r. wanke', 'j. -k. woo', 'm. wurm', 's. xella', 'd. yilmaz', 'a. u. yilmazer', 'c. s. yoon', 'yu. zaytsev']",the active muon shield in the ship experiment,http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03612v2,2017
"the difference in proton radii measured with $\mu p$ atoms and with $ep$.atoms and scattering remains an unexplained puzzle. the psi muse proposal is to.measure $\mu p$ and $e p$ scattering in the same experiment at the same time..the experiment will determine cross sections, two-photon effects, form factors,.and radii independently for the two reactions, and will allow $\mu p$ and $ep$.results to be compared with reduced systematic uncertainties. these data should.provide the best test of lepton universality in a scattering experiment to.date, about an order of magnitude improvement over previous tests. measuring.scattering with both particle polarities will allow a test of two-photon.exchange at the sub-percent level, about a factor of four improvement on.uncertainties and over an order of magnitude more data points than previous low.momentum transfer determinations, and similar to the current generation of.higher momentum transfer electron experiments. the experiment has the potential.to demonstrate whether the $\mu p$ and $ep$ interactions are consistent or.different, and whether any difference results from novel physics or two-photon.exchange. the uncertainties are such that if the discrepancy is real it should.be confirmed with $\approx$5$\sigma$ significance, similar to that already.established between the regular and muonic hydrogen lamb shift.","['r. gilman', 'e. j. downie', 'g. ron', 's. strauch', 'a. afanasev', 'a. akmal', 'j. arrington', 'h. atac', 'c. ayerbe-gayoso', 'f. benmokhtar', 'n. benmouna', 'j. bernauer', 'a. blomberg', 'w. j. briscoe', 'd. cioffi', 'e. cline', 'd. cohen', 'e. o. cohen', 'c. collicott', 'k. deiters', 'j. diefenbach', 'b. dongwi', 'd. ghosal', 'a. golossanov', 'r. gothe', 'd. higinbotham', 'd. hornidge', 'y. ilieva', 'n. kalantarians', 'm. kohl', 'b. krusche', 'g. kumbartzki', 'i. lavrukhin', 'l. li', 'j. lichtenstadt', 'w. lin', 'a. liyanage', 'w. lorenzon', 'k. e. mesick', 'z. -e. meziani', 'p. mohanmurthy', 'p. moran', 'j. nazeer', 'e. piasetzsky', 'r. ransome', 'r. raymond', 'd. reggiani', 'p. e. reimer', 'a. richter', 't. rostomyan', 'p. roy', 'a. sarty', 'y. shamai', 'n. sparveris', 'n. steinberg', 'i. strakovsky', 'v. sulkosky', 'a. s. tadepalli', 'm. taragin']","technical design report for the paul scherrer institute experiment.  r-12-01.1: studying the proton ""radius"" puzzle with μp elastic scattering",http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.09753v1,2017
